Adding and subtracting negative numbers might seem a bit confusing at first, but with a little understanding and practice, it can become quite straightforward. This topic is a fundamental aspect of mathematics that is used in various fields such as physics, economics, and computer science.

When dealing with negative numbers, it's important to remember that they are simply numbers less than zero. They are represented by a minus (-) sign before the number. For example, -3, -10, -20 are all negative numbers. 

The first concept to understand is adding negative numbers. When adding a negative number, it is equivalent to subtracting the absolute value of that number. The absolute value is the number without its sign. For example, if we add -3 to 5, it is equivalent to subtracting 3 from 5, which gives us 2. So, 5 + (-3) = 2. This works the same way for adding two negative numbers. If we add -3 and -2, it is equivalent to subtracting 3 and 2, which gives us -5. So, -3 + (-2) = -5. 

Subtracting negative numbers is a little trickier. When you subtract a negative number, it is equivalent to adding the absolute value of that number. This is due to the concept that subtracting a negative is the same as going in the opposite direction, which in mathematical terms, means adding. For example, if we subtract -3 from 5, it is equivalent to adding 3 to 5, which gives us 8. So, 5 - (-3) = 8. Similarly, if we subtract -3 from -2, it is equivalent to adding 3 to -2, which gives us 1. So, -2 - (-3) = 1.

Now, let's look at some rules to simplify the process of adding and subtracting negative numbers:

1. Adding two negative numbers always gives a negative result. For example, -3 + -2 = -5.
2. Subtracting a negative number from a positive number gives a positive result. For example, 3 - (-2) = 5.
3. Subtracting a negative number from a negative number can give either a positive or a negative result, depending on the numbers' absolute values. For example, -3 - (-5) = 2, but -5 - (-3) = -2.
4. Adding a negative number to a positive number can give either a positive or a negative result, depending on the numbers' absolute values. For example, 5 + (-3) = 2, but 3 + (-5) = -2.

The number line is a useful tool for understanding these rules. Positive numbers are to the right of zero, and negative numbers are to the left. When adding a negative number, you move to the left on the number line. When subtracting a negative number, you move to the right.

In conclusion, adding and subtracting negative numbers is not as complicated as it may initially seem. The key is to remember that adding a negative number is the same as subtracting its absolute value, and subtracting a negative number is the same as adding its absolute value. With these rules in mind and a bit of practice, you'll be able to handle negative numbers with ease.
