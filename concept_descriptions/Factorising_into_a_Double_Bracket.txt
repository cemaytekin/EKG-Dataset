Factorising into a Double Bracket is a fundamental concept in algebra that involves expressing a given algebraic expression in the form of two brackets. It is a crucial step in solving many algebraic problems, especially those involving quadratic equations. The process of factorising into a double bracket involves breaking down the expression into simpler, more manageable parts. This concept is vital in mathematics and is often used in solving equations, simplifying expressions, and finding roots of polynomials.

Factorising into a double bracket is often used when dealing with quadratic expressions. A quadratic expression is a polynomial of degree two. The general form of a quadratic expression is ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants, and x is a variable. The process of factorising a quadratic expression involves expressing it as a product of two binomial expressions. For instance, the quadratic expression x^2 + 5x + 6 can be factorised into a double bracket as (x + 2)(x + 3).

The process of factorising into a double bracket involves several steps. The first step is to identify the coefficients of the quadratic expression. The coefficient of x^2 is a, the coefficient of x is b, and the constant term is c. The next step is to find two numbers that add up to b and multiply to give c. These two numbers are the coefficients of x in the binomial expressions. 

Once these two numbers are found, the quadratic expression can be written as a product of two binomial expressions. For example, in the quadratic expression x^2 + 5x + 6, the coefficients of x in the binomial expressions are 2 and 3. Therefore, the expression can be written as (x + 2)(x + 3).

The process of factorising into a double bracket is not always straightforward. In some cases, it may be necessary to factorise the expression further or use other algebraic techniques. For example, if the coefficient of x^2 is not 1, it may be necessary to factorise by grouping. If the expression cannot be factorised using integers, it may be necessary to use the quadratic formula or complete the square.

Factorising into a double bracket is a powerful tool in algebra. It allows us to simplify complex expressions and solve quadratic equations. It also provides a method for finding the roots of a quadratic equation. The roots of a quadratic equation are the values of x that make the equation equal to zero. By factorising the equation into a double bracket, we can easily find these roots by setting each bracket equal to zero.

In conclusion, factorising into a double bracket is a fundamental concept in algebra that involves breaking down a quadratic expression into a product of two binomial expressions. It is a crucial step in solving many algebraic problems and is often used in solving equations, simplifying expressions, and finding roots of polynomials. Understanding this concept is vital for anyone studying mathematics, as it forms the basis for many more advanced topics.
