Volume and capacity are fundamental concepts in the field of measurement and are used extensively in science, engineering, and daily life. In essence, volume is the amount of space that an object occupies, while capacity refers to the amount of substance, like a liquid or gas, that a container can hold. Both are typically measured in units that are derived from the length measurements in the metric system, such as cubic centimeters (cm³) or cubic meters (m³), or in the U.S. customary units like cubic inches (in³) or cubic feet (ft³).

In the International System of Units (SI), the standard unit of volume is the cubic meter. It is a unit derived from the meter, which is the SI unit of length. A cubic meter is the volume of a cube with edges one meter in length. It's a large unit, so for practical purposes, smaller units like cubic centimeters or cubic millimeters are often used, especially in scientific work. 

The liter, which is not an SI unit but is accepted for use with the SI, is another common unit of volume. It is equivalent to one cubic decimeter (dm³), or 1,000 cubic centimeters (cm³). The liter is often used in daily life, for example, to measure the volume of liquids like water and milk or gases. Smaller units derived from the liter include the milliliter (ml), which is 1/1,000 of a liter, and the microliter (µl), which is 1/1,000,000 of a liter.

In the U.S. customary system of units, volume is often measured in cubic inches, cubic feet, and cubic yards. These units are used in many areas, including construction and manufacturing. For example, the volume of a room might be measured in cubic feet, while the volume of a truck or a large container might be measured in cubic yards. 

The U.S. customary system also has special units for measuring the volumes of liquids and gases. The most commonly used are the fluid ounce, the pint, the quart, and the gallon. A fluid ounce is approximately 29.57 ml, a pint consists of 16 fluid ounces, a quart is 2 pints, and a gallon is 4 quarts. These units are often used in cooking and in the food industry.

Capacity, on the other hand, is a measure of how much a container can hold. It's closely related to volume, but there's a subtle difference. While volume is a measure of space, capacity is a measure of substance. For example, a bottle might have a volume of 500 ml, but its capacity might be less if it can't be filled to the brim.

The units of capacity are the same as those of volume. In the SI, capacity is often measured in liters and milliliters, while in the U.S. customary system, it's typically measured in fluid ounces, pints, quarts, and gallons. 

In conclusion, volume and capacity are fundamental concepts in measurement, with a wide range of applications in various fields. They are measured in units derived from the metric system or the U.S. customary system, depending on the context. Understanding these units and how to convert between them is essential for anyone working in a field that involves measurements of space or substance.
