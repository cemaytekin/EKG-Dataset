Compound area, also known as composite area, is a key concept in geometry that involves finding the total area of a shape that is comprised of several simpler shapes. These simpler shapes are often basic geometric figures such as rectangles, squares, triangles, circles, and so on. The compound area provides a practical method to calculate the area of complex or irregular shapes by breaking them down into these simpler, more manageable shapes.

The process of finding the compound area involves several steps. First, you need to identify the individual shapes that make up the compound shape. This requires a good understanding of basic geometric shapes and their properties. For instance, a compound shape may be composed of a rectangle and a triangle, or two circles and a rectangle, and so on. 

Once you have identified the individual shapes, the next step is to calculate the area of each shape separately. This is where knowledge of the formulas for finding the area of basic geometric shapes comes in handy. For example, the area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width, the area of a triangle is found by multiplying its base by its height and then dividing by two, and the area of a circle is found by squaring its radius and then multiplying by pi.

After finding the area of each individual shape, you then add all these areas together to get the total compound area. This is based on the principle that the total area of a shape is the sum of the areas of its parts. However, in some cases, you may need to subtract areas rather than adding them. For instance, if a shape is 'cut out' from another shape, you would need to subtract the area of the cut-out shape from the area of the larger shape.

One of the key benefits of understanding compound areas is that it allows you to tackle real-world problems that involve irregular shapes. For instance, if you're planning a landscaping project and you need to calculate the area of your yard, which is an irregular shape, you can break it down into simpler shapes, calculate the area of each, and then add them up. Similarly, architects and engineers often use the concept of compound area in their work to calculate the area of complex structures.

In conclusion, compound area is a fundamental concept in geometry that combines the principles of basic geometric shapes to calculate the area of complex or irregular shapes. It involves identifying the individual shapes that make up the compound shape, calculating the area of each individual shape, and then adding or subtracting these areas to get the total compound area. Understanding compound area not only enhances your problem-solving skills in mathematics but also has practical applications in various fields such as architecture, engineering, and landscaping.
