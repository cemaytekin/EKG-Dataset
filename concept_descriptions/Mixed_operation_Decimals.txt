Mixed Operation Decimals is a mathematical concept that deals with the application of various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on decimal numbers. This concept is an extension of the mixed operation arithmetic that we learn in elementary mathematics, now applied to decimal numbers. Understanding this concept is crucial as it forms the basis for many real-life applications, including finance, engineering, physics, and other scientific calculations.

To understand mixed operation decimals, one must first understand what decimal numbers are. Decimals are a way of representing fractions and whole numbers together. They use a decimal point to separate the whole number part from the fractional part. For example, in the number 10.25, 10 is the whole number part, and 25 is the fractional part.

Now, let's delve into the four basic operations involved in mixed operation decimals:

1. Addition: Adding decimal numbers is similar to adding whole numbers. The only thing to remember is to line up the decimal points. For instance, if you want to add 2.3 and 1.45, you would write it as:

   2.30
 + 1.45
 ______
   3.75

2. Subtraction: Subtraction of decimals is also similar to subtraction of whole numbers. Again, the decimal points should be aligned. For example, to subtract 1.45 from 2.3, you would write it as:

   2.30
 - 1.45
 ______
   0.85

3. Multiplication: When multiplying decimals, do not worry about the decimal points during the multiplication. Multiply as if they are whole numbers and then count the number of digits after the decimal in the original numbers and place the decimal in your answer so that there is the same number of digits after it. For example, to multiply 2.3 by 1.4, you would calculate as:

   2.3 (one digit after the decimal)
 x 1.4 (one digit after the decimal)
 ______
   3.22 (two digits after the decimal)

4. Division: Division of decimals is slightly more complex. If the divisor is a whole number, divide as usual. If the divisor is a decimal, convert it to a whole number by shifting the decimal point to the right and do the same with the dividend. For example, to divide 2.3 by 1.5, you would calculate as:

   23 รท 15 = 1.53

In mixed operation decimals, it's common to have problems that involve more than one operation. In such cases, follow the BIDMAS/BODMAS rule (Brackets, Indices, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)). For example, to calculate 2.5 + 1.5 * 3, you would first do the multiplication and then the addition:

   2.5 + (1.5 * 3) = 2.5 + 4.5 = 7

In conclusion, mixed operation decimals extend our understanding of basic arithmetic operations to decimal numbers. They require careful attention to the placement of decimal points and the order of operations. With practice, one can become proficient in performing these operations, which are essential tools in many areas of study and everyday life.
