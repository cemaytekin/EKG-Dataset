Mixed operation with negative numbers is an important concept in mathematics that involves the fundamental operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This topic requires a strong understanding of the rules of operations with negative numbers, which can sometimes appear confusing to some students. However, with a clear explanation and consistent practice, working with negative numbers can become more intuitive and less daunting.

To start, let's establish a fundamental rule: A positive number is greater than a negative number. For instance, +3 is greater than -3. This rule is essential in understanding how to perform operations with negative numbers.

In addition, there are some key rules to remember when performing mixed operations with negative numbers:

1. Addition and Subtraction: When adding or subtracting negative numbers, it's important to remember that adding a negative number is the same as subtracting a positive number. For example, 5 + (-3) is the same as 5 - 3, which equals 2. Similarly, if you subtract a negative number, it's the same as adding a positive number. For example, 5 - (-3) equals 5 + 3, which is 8.

2. Multiplication and Division: When multiplying or dividing negative numbers, remember that multiplying or dividing two negative numbers gives a positive result. For example, -3 * -3 equals 9, and -6 / -2 equals 3. However, if you multiply or divide a positive number and a negative number, the result will be negative. For example, -3 * 3 equals -9, and 6 / -2 equals -3.

Now, when it comes to mixed operations with negative numbers, the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS or PEMDAS (Brackets/parentheses, Indices/Exponents, Division and Multiplication from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right), is crucial. 

For example, let's consider the expression -3 + 4 * 2. According to the order of operations, multiplication should be performed before addition. So, you multiply 4 and 2 to get 8, then add -3 to get 5.

In a more complex example, such as 2 - (-2) + 3 * (-1), you would first negate the negative number, making the equation 2 - (-2) + 3 * (-1) = 2 + 2 - 3 = 1.

When parentheses are involved, operations inside the parentheses should be performed first. For example, in the expression -3 + (4 * 2), you would first perform the multiplication inside the parentheses to get 8, then add -3 to get 5.

In conclusion, mixed operations with negative numbers can seem complex, but by following the rules and order of operations, they can be simplified and solved accurately. It is important to practice these operations to gain confidence and fluency. The more you practice, the more intuitive these operations will become. Remember, mathematics is a language, and like any language, it becomes easier to understand and use the more you practice it.
