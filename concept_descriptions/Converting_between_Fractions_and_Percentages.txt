Understanding the concept of converting between fractions and percentages is a fundamental skill in mathematics. This concept is not only important in academic settings but also in practical, real-life situations such as calculating discounts, tax rates, and interest rates. This article aims to explain in detail how to convert between fractions and percentages.

Firstly, it is crucial to understand what fractions and percentages represent. A fraction is a way of expressing a part of a whole. It consists of a numerator (the top number) and a denominator (the bottom number). The numerator represents the part of the whole, while the denominator represents the total number of equal parts into which the whole is divided.

On the other hand, a percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The term "per cent" literally means "per hundred". Therefore, a percentage is a fraction with a denominator of 100.

To convert a fraction to a percentage, you need to make the denominator of the fraction 100. This can be done by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by the same number, such that the denominator becomes 100. Once this is done, the numerator becomes the percentage. For example, to convert the fraction 3/4 to a percentage, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 25. This gives you 75/100, which is 75%.

If the denominator of the fraction is not a factor of 100, you can convert the fraction to a decimal first, and then convert the decimal to a percentage. To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator. Then, to convert the decimal to a percentage, multiply the decimal by 100. For example, to convert the fraction 2/3 to a percentage, first convert it to a decimal by dividing 2 by 3 to get 0.6667. Then, multiply 0.6667 by 100 to get 66.67%.

To convert a percentage to a fraction, you need to convert the percentage back to a fraction with a denominator of 100. This is done by writing the percentage as the numerator and 100 as the denominator. Then, simplify the fraction to its lowest terms by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor. For example, to convert the percentage 75% to a fraction, write it as 75/100. Then, simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 25 to get 3/4.

In summary, understanding how to convert between fractions and percentages is a fundamental mathematical skill. It involves understanding the relationship between fractions and percentages, converting fractions to percentages by making the denominator 100 or by converting to a decimal first, and converting percentages to fractions by writing the percentage as a fraction of 100 and then simplifying it to its lowest terms. With practice, this process will become more intuitive and you will be able to perform these conversions quickly and accurately.
