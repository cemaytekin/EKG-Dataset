Percentage increase and decrease are essential mathematical concepts that are widely used in many fields such as finance, business, economics, and statistics. They provide a way to express the change in a quantity as a percentage of its original value, allowing for a more intuitive understanding of the change.

The percentage increase or decrease is calculated by comparing the difference between two numbers to the original number. This comparison provides a relative measure of the change, rather than an absolute one, which can be more meaningful in many contexts. For instance, an increase of $100 might not mean much if you are talking about a company's annual revenue, but it could be significant if you are talking about a weekly grocery budget.

To calculate the percentage increase, you subtract the original number from the new number to find the amount of the increase. Then, you divide this increase by the original number and multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage. For example, if a price increases from $50 to $75, the amount of the increase is $75 - $50 = $25. The percentage increase is then ($25 / $50) x 100 = 50%. This means the price has increased by 50% of its original value.

Similarly, to calculate the percentage decrease, you subtract the new number from the original number to find the amount of the decrease. Then, you divide this decrease by the original number and multiply by 100. For example, if a price decreases from $50 to $40, the amount of the decrease is $50 - $40 = $10. The percentage decrease is then ($10 / $50) x 100 = 20%. This means the price has decreased by 20% of its original value.

It's important to note that percentage increase and decrease are not symmetrical. For instance, if a price increases by 50%, it would need to decrease by 33.33%, not 50%, to return to its original value. This is because the percentage increase is based on the lower original value, while the percentage decrease is based on the higher new value.

Understanding percentage increase and decrease is particularly crucial in the world of finance and business. For example, companies often track the percentage change in their revenues, profits, or share prices over time. Investors and analysts use these percentages to assess a company's performance and make decisions about buying or selling its shares.

Moreover, percentage increase and decrease are also used in everyday life. For instance, they are used to calculate the rate of inflation, which measures the percentage change in the overall price level in an economy. They are also used to calculate interest rates, discounts, sales growth, and many other quantities.

In conclusion, percentage increase and decrease are powerful tools that provide a way to express changes in quantities in a relative manner. They are fundamental concepts in mathematics and are widely used in many fields. By understanding these concepts, one can better interpret and analyze changes in a wide range of contexts.
