Simplifying expressions by collecting like terms is a fundamental concept in algebra and is essential for solving complex mathematical problems. This process involves combining terms that have the same variable and/or exponent to simplify the expression and make it more manageable.

To understand this concept in detail, it's crucial to first understand what 'like terms' are. Like terms are terms that contain the same variables raised to the same power. For example, 2x and 3x are like terms because they both contain the variable 'x' raised to the power of 1. Similarly, 4y^2 and 5y^2 are like terms because they both contain the variable 'y' raised to the power of 2. However, 2x and 2y are not like terms because they contain different variables.

Now, let's delve into the process of simplifying expressions by collecting like terms. Consider the algebraic expression 3x + 2x. By the definition of like terms, these two terms can be combined. When we combine them, we add or subtract the numerical coefficients, while the variable part remains the same. So, 3x + 2x simplifies to 5x.

The same principle applies when the expression involves subtraction. For example, in the expression 7y - 3y, the like terms are 7y and -3y. When we combine them, we get 4y.

It's important to note that the operation between the terms (addition or subtraction) is carried over to the coefficients. So, if the expression was 7y - 3y, we subtract 3 from 7 to get 4y. If the expression was 3x + 2x, we add 2 to 3 to get 5x.

In more complex expressions with multiple terms, the process remains the same. We identify and group like terms, then combine them by adding or subtracting their coefficients. For instance, in the expression 4x + 2y + 3x - y, we can group the 'x' terms (4x and 3x) and the 'y' terms (2y and -y) separately. This gives us (4x + 3x) + (2y - y), which simplifies to 7x + y.

It's also worth noting that in expressions with multiple variables, terms are only considered like terms if they contain the exact same variables raised to the same powers. For instance, in the expression 2xy + 3xy - x^2, the terms 2xy and 3xy are like terms, but the term x^2 is not a like term with the others because it does not contain the variable 'y'.

In conclusion, simplifying expressions by collecting like terms is a crucial skill in algebra. It allows us to reduce complex expressions to simpler forms, making them easier to handle and understand. The process involves identifying like terms, grouping them together, and combining them by adding or subtracting their coefficients. It's a straightforward process, but one that requires careful attention to detail to ensure that only like terms are combined.
